# Welcome! 

This is my attempt at solving the problems necessary to build a dynamic mission for DCS. 

# Things to know. 

I don't put everything in the journal. Check out the latest code for the full context, and even bugfixes. 

I sometimes drink while I program. 

You'll definitely find some, if not all of this helpful, or at least useful. 

# Why am I doing this?

I love flight sims. I love DCS. I know how to write code. Why not take a swing at writing a dynamic campaign? Well, 
that, and none of the existing campaigns have gone more than a few weeks before everyone has target lat/lon on a DTC 
mod, and memorized the sam site compositions. I want to make something that can evolve, and be adapted to large or small 
scale scenarios for a flexible number of players.

You can check out my deranged thought processes, and keep up with development in the [Journal](./JOURNAL.md), where I'll be updating the problems, and solutions I encounter along
my Lua Journey.
